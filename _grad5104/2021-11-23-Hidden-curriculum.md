We started to discuss the hidden curriculum in academia this week, something akin to 'Easter Eggs' in movies: unless you don't see the movie, you don't know. Similarly, unless you experience it yourself at a university or a research institute, it is difficult to understand the hidden curriculum. For example, before coming to Virginia Tech, I had no idea that football games are a huge deal and that the whole town is either closed or stuck in traffic and it's best not to venture out those weekends for a bite or a drink (or even order takeout!). As someone coming from an entirely different country having barely an idea of how the US university system works, my peers helped me when I came here. I often thought of writing a 'hidden curriculum' document after coming here to help my upcoming peers but the volume of work made me forget about it after a while.
