Long time, eh? Well, I enevr said this was going to be a damn diary. You have irregular entries with mispellings; that's how a blog post is written. This is not a blog post detailing how quarks work or how droplets remain the same volume but decreas ein decrease in surface area when falling in a stream(rayleigh instabilty): lthough I would have still kept the spelling different. Would have made a spelling constest with students and giving an A if you get that right. Graduate students love these freebies.

Today is the 102nd birthday of the great professor and teacher, Dr. Richard Feynman- the person who not just inspired the blog title but also the person who stays awake at 12 am to write this blog post.As the world tries to emerge from this pandemic which has proved a big pain and we try to pretend we have a normal working lifestyle, it can be good to talk a little more about a great man but not his biography- that sure would help the reader and probably the man himself to sleep. 

I recently connected with some friends in school as I mentioned previously. we had a nice videocall that lasted three hours on a weekday impairing my research capability for some time. Now, I saw these fellas after 2013 (If you remember, it is 2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019 and 2020- seven years). I tried to catch them up as to where I am and all. I expected them to change a lot since school but I was bewildered at how they have remained the same and infact, introduced their college friends to each other. The same 'infighting', 'annoying each other' was present. And I confess, back in school, I was a ringleader myself and I enjoyed doing it. But it's been 7 freaking years- Sherlock ran for 7 years with the first season absolutely brilliant and the final one tanking off. This time at the best, I could say I was slightly amused and at the worst, I was pissed off. That is not dopey anymore! It's plain stupid!

I talked about this to my mom and how, unlike the others in the group, did not keep enough contact with these people who I feel were my best friends at school. I simply lost contact after I went to college and I never bothered to restart it. This is not a love of math that could be restarted in a new form, you know..it's just different. And I now feel I am different than all of them- maybe a little more serious, maybe a little less childlike and I could reflect where I was in 2013 and otherwise. And I feel if I could have been guided more, to read more, to study more, to study not for grades, but for **fun**, **for the pleasure of finding things out**. And I never did that- all I did was grades, exams and now I feel they don't matter as much as I know how something can be enjoyed by doing it. As Dr. Feynman would quote,

> *"There is pleasure in recognising old things from a new viewpoint."*

And I feel pleasure as to how I changed, how my mindset changed, how I thought I was done with studying, I was saturated and I just want to be an engineer at a big IT company in India with no knowledge growth and how I am a grad student today, at a great school learning something new everyday as I work and widen a small part of the horizon. I still want to know more, there is no saturation, I still want to learn something, not just fluids but anything. There might be some people who are satisfied with their knowledge, who don't want to learn anything new. For those people, I have another Dr. Feynman quote,

> *"Don't you have time to think?"*

Happy birthday Dr. Richard Feynman!!
