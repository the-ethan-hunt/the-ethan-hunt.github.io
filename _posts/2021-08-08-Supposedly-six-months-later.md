Hello there, how are you doing? Well as the title suggests, I was planning to wite a post six months later but what the hell, you were not expecting me to fulfill that 'commitment' on the 4th of july, right? Well, we can just assume it is six months in the pandemic time; that's a pretty good scale. But yeah,a  lot of things have happened since we visited this rusty old blog which somehow still comes up on like the 5th site when you google my name (Goddamnit, Google):
1) I completed my spring semester with retaining almost perfect sanity
2) Decided to become more social- can't stay in the shell anymore.
3) Went on two trips- one to this country place called Duffield on the Virginia-Tennesse border in April and later to Cape Canaveral,FL for two days. Now, I have laos later visited DC and my family in the Tri-State area but the Cape Canaveral visit is somehow one of the best trips of my life. The reason itself was so interesting- to see a launch at 3 am on a lakeside and it was magical. Of course, it's Florida, so we hit the beach too. And the company was great. Imagine just some crazy people driving down south just to see a launch we could have seen on television: but it was fun and worth it: we could not have seen it that cool on the damn TV and could n't have been that interesting. 

I am still trying to continue on a vegan diet-it's tough, lemme tell ya but I think it's worth it as it reduces my carbon footprint and balances the fact that I use cars more frequently (BTW, I got my drivers license- it's the DMV's fault!). My close friend who was also trying to vegan left town permanently last week and it was not as sad as I thought. Someday, even I would be doing the same, biding goodbye and maybe not coming here again: jeez, especially not in the winter. I have not **at all** acustommed to the 'American Winter' where the Sun sets at 5 pm making me cranky. I hope I live in the Sun Belt or SoCal so I don't experience the winter at all- fortunately they got some good universities down there where I could work. The perfect dream would be to live in a place where if bored, I could hit the beach within half an hour and spend most of my evening and sunday morning on a nice beach , walking in the sand or just reading something for the pleasure of finding things out!

I also have decided to take a break from Fluids courses- I am a bit overwhelmed at the level of coursework I did in the Spring and I need some much needed change: I have this group of friends at the department and we often discuss fluids since we all work on fluids. And I often feel to join other groups where we discuss something other than fluids, because that's all I do. I understand some people think aerospace engineering is interesting but I also feel what others do is equally, or sometimes even more interesting. Like you meet someone  who works 'at the intersection of human nutrition and chemistry' and that interests me more ...I want to know what you exactly do and how are you trying to achieve it. And then you get a repsonse something along th lines, "I am trying to study the cholestrol composition in oily foods so we can eat oil food without fearing for our health" and that makes me even more interested. I undertsand what I do has a lot of applications too like, submarines but you need to believe it that not a lot of people own submarines! 

And that makes me much more curious in what other people are doing- not from an 'elitist' point of view but it just seems interesting. My recent interest has been to read more about modelling oil spills, something Big Oil would be interested in but I don't expect my self to be working for them- nah, I would be working to improve how I convey this knowledge to more students, undergrad and grad: As Dr. Feynman said, "The greatest test of your knowledge is your capacity to convey it to others!"

See you lter! (maybe in another 6 months perhaps!)
