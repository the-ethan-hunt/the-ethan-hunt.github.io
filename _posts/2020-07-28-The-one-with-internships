Hello down there! Long time, eh? Well this is not a weekly newsletter you were expecting about a grad student in AOE ranting about his research and life in particular. You can see the news channels for that stuff. But I must agree, I need to work out ways to encounter my temporary writer's block and work more on the posts- maybe once in 2 weeks or something.

I am currently bck in the great Commonwealth of Virginia from Florida and currently enduring final days of my 2 week quarantine. It was one hell of a time (as always!) in Florida with close reports of how coronavirus is ripping lives apart. Anyways, we need not talk about that more.

I recently read a tweet from someone on Twitter stating that unpaid internships should be made illegal. And then there were company owners who stated that interns learn stuff from their companies and the moment they are 'productive' they dump the company for greener pastures. In fact, there was one genius at a high executive position in a big company who said istead of receiving stipend, interns should pay gurudakshina( Sanskrit for tuition fees). Well, I'ill be damned!

I worked through internships in the summer and one spring through 3 years of my undergrad- all unpaid. My summer research this year for three months was paid as a 20hr internship with a decent stipend. I have been on both sides of the grass and to show this I bragged about myself in the previous statement. I do not care if it's an undergrad or grad student- if he\she is doing an internship, it DESERVES to be paid.

Because, while company owners devote their "precious time" which could have been spent on finding out the hidden features of MS Excel, students spend a jolly good worth of their time too learning all this, spending time in airless corporate offices instead of going on a trip with friends somewhere in the world. And not to offend MS Excel (that is a brilliant invention btw) but students do devote their precious time to work- and the Asian logic of "paid in knowledge" is stupid. Company owners get ideas these young Turks think about (I think they call it innovation in the entreprenuership industry). Plus if a great intern goes to greener pastures, the "ex" would have made a good mark on his/her next company as they would have realized the amount of knowledge this person possesses. Not to forget, the intern has a choice- the corporate world is a free one, god damn it!

The whole thread about how company owners think about interns as just some stupid people who are being raised to the level of excellence by Indian company owners is nauseous. It reflects the toxic and not to forget, needlessly stupid  corporate culture we have. there should be an equal bargain on both the sides. Let's think of the other sid eof the story.

Today, a lof of us feel we are so important that we deserve to do the best job. If you are working as a software dev, your first task should be testing and checking out how code works rather than inventing your own code. At a manufacturing plant? how the chain works, how the production floor functions before you lay out your own dopey operational plan. And some of us don't get it. I spend around 5 mins a day on LinkedIn's forum and I see posts of junior or even barely graudated students giving life advices and how to work and how to run companies. Well, life is not about how to run companies! I remember the story of Dr. Feynman working out at Thinking Machines Inc with his first job being buying office supplies.  You start from a small task and end up working something beautiful- you just can't start with it. And it bedazzles me how people think like that as such a young age, how they are able to figure out the next 30-40 years of their life(I for the moment, can barely figure out what I am going to do in the next 2-3 years). And if the next 40 years of their life is about posting this "career advice" daily for "daily motivation" so they can have good audience, it's all baloney. Explore the world. Study anything that piques your interest. As Dr. Feynman used to day, "Nobody ever figures what life is all about and it doesn't really matter". Do something you may like and who knows, you may fall in love doing the thing!

That's it for today!! Thank you very much.
