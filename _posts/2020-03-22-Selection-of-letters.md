Hello down there!
Concerning the recent events, I guess from wherever this blog is getting its traffic, you are sitting at home thinking as to why the hell this dang virus had to happen and trying to work at the same efficiency.
* In cse you are someone after 2021, this blog post was written during the 2020 Coronavirus outbreak. I enjoyed reading about Feynman and working out math.

This virus thing has got me down with work at home too. I recenty shifted all my stuff back at my apartment and have been trying to ever since. I also have been completed the book, "Perfectly Deviations from the Beaten Track" which has sevevral letters written to and by Dr. Richard Feynman. That reminds me I never told you guys how is this book and my blog title related. Well, the beaten track here refers to Ph.D. which is what I tend to do in my free time and Perfectly reasonable deviations mean I am deviating from a day of research to write about my life in a post. That's perfectly reasonable and dopey I must say.

Coming back to the book, I am almost finishing it and saw two letters I like to share. First the funny one:

## Letter 1: 
![alt text](https://the-ethan-hunt.github.io/images/20200322_203644.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")

In case the letter seems in a different language, tilt that head of yours and see: it's written in English. It is a letter by Prof. Feynman to a conference he was invited to attend. The moment I read "On item 1 what the hell..." I started hearing his "what the hell" from the audo "Los Alamos from Below" and started laughing for a solid 5 minutes. The goofiness in Prof. Feynman is something we should try to emulate no matter who we are. It's dopey and makes the other person smile. Now, if that person be someone you have a liking to, best of luck to your endeavors!
That' what I like aboyt Prof. Feynman. Nobel Prize Winner, Princeton grad, CalTech prof..who in the world cares? Just enjoy life with a spoonful of goofines in it.

## Letter 2
![alt text](https://the-ethan-hunt.github.io/images/20200322_203858.jpg)

This is more of a serious letter from a lecturer Frank Potter to Prof. Feynman who used to go with him to Hughes Research Lab every weekend. Bruce Winstein once asked Prof. Feynman "If you could do something different in your career, wat would it be" to which Prof. Feynman replied "I would try to forget how I had solved a problem. Then each time the problem arose, I would solve it in a different way...."
This is very similar to his quote: "There is pleasure in recognizing old things from a new viewpoint." You try to look at anything, not just a academic problem but perhaps a life experience now and compare how you were reacting to it and it might make you happy that you have done better (or worse). I see the spring 2018 about how dejected I was over some stuff and now that I have put it all behind and am enjoying here doing research and what have you. It totally makes the absolute sense. In case it does, I would advise you to go to hell.

A lot of these letters are very funny or motivating .It is indeed funny to see the thoughts of such a man outside his celebrity life. I was thinking once this book is completed I might go complete Chief of Station Congo or reread Feynman's Rainbow another awesome book about Prof. Feynman by Leonard Mlodinow.

Well, I have told you about the blog's title and shared some snapshots about a book. That's it for today,see y'all!
