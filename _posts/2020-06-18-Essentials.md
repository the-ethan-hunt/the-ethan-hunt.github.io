Hello down there! It's been a month now since I wrote the last post but I have been really serious about the fact that I won't write regularly. I recently shifted to Florida sometime back and have been living here since a month now. The reason is also that I don't know what I am supposed to write and I don't want ramblings to be written here; this is a blog not a teenager's stupid diary.

Looking at recent surge of COVID19 cases in the states of Arizona, Florida and California and new cases in Beijing and New Zealand, there is a opinion that a second COVID19 wave will begin and may have to work form home again next year. One thing to note here is that most workplaces and colleges in the country have decided to operate on-campus for the Fall before resorting to online format in the Spring. I am a bit of glad and cautious about thi: I can finally leave my small cubbyhole of a room for the lab for some time and interact in-face with people while being a little less safer. Could the world BE any more unsafe?

One important thing to note here is the resurgence of cases in China which has meant the country will go gain in lockdown except for essential services like hospitals. The services which will lock down include schools- that means school were never essential. And that is bloody true for one learns everything by self-study only. To quote the great John Nash, Jr, "classes will dull your mind, destroy the potential for authentic creativity". You need to think stuff, not just memorize it.

One thing where I feel weakened is my technical writing skills- I suck at writing and now this feels like a giant task- writing papers and in the future , grants in academia. And I am reading blog posts and asking to friends in research but I have hit a wall- seems I need to break through the wall to learn it.
